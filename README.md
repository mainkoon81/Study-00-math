#### 1. Introduction to Kalman Filters
A Kalman Filter is an algorithm which uses noisy sensor measurements (and Bayes' Rule) to produce reliable estimates of unknown quantities (like where a vehicle is likely to be in 3 seconds).

#### 2. State and Object Oriented Programming
What is the "state" of a self driving car? What quantities do we need to keep track of when programming a car to drive itself? How roboticists think about "state" and how to use a programming tool called object oriented programming to manage that "state".

#### 3. Matrices and Transformations
When a problem can be framed in the language of matrices, it's often possible to find programmatic solutions which are effective and very fast.

## 1. Kalman Filters
: Estimate future locations and velocities based on data.
 - Markov Model says our world is divided into **discrete grids**, and we assign to each grid a certain probability. Such a representation over spaces is called **histogram**.

Performing a **measurement** meant updating our belief by a multiplicative factor, while **moving** involved performing a convolution.

 - In Kalman filter, the distribution is given by 'Gaussian':
   - CONTINUOUS: a continuous function over the space of locations
   - UNI-MODAL
   - the area underneath sums up to 1 
   - Rather than estimating entire distribution as a histogram, we maintain the 'mu', 'variance' that is our best estimate of the location of our object we want to find.

> UPDATE: Measurement & Motion (in the 1d-world)
 - Kalman filter iterates 2 updates- 'measurement', 'motion'. This is identical to the situation before in localization where we got a measurement then we took a motion. 
   - **Measurement:** meant updating our belief (and renormalizing our distribution, using BayesRule; product).
   - **Motion:** meant keeping track of where all of our probability "went" when we moved (using the law of Total Probability; convolution).

> STATE (in the 2d,3d-world)  
 - In order to actually make a Kalman Filter in a 2d or 3d world (or "state space" in the language of robotics), we will first need to learn more about what exactly we mean when we use this word "state".
 - Localization: All self-driving cars go through the same series of steps to safely navigate through the world. The first step is localization. Before cars can safely navigate, they first use sensors and other collected data to best estimate where they are in the world.
 - The Kalman Filter simply repeats the sense and move (measurement and prediction) steps to localize the car as itâ€™s moving!

 - The Takeaway: The beauty of Kalman filters is that they combine somewhat inaccurate sensor measurements with somewhat inaccurate predictions of motion to get a filtered location estimate that is better than any estimates that come from only sensor readings or only knowledge about movement.
