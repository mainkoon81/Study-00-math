#### 1. Introduction to Kalman Filters
A Kalman Filter is an algorithm which uses noisy sensor measurements (and Bayes' Rule) to produce reliable estimates of unknown quantities (like where a vehicle is likely to be in 3 seconds).

#### 2. State and Object Oriented Programming
What is the "state" of a self driving car? What quantities do we need to keep track of when programming a car to drive itself? How roboticists think about "state" and how to use a programming tool called object oriented programming to manage that "state".

#### 3. Matrices and Transformations
When a problem can be framed in the language of matrices, it's often possible to find programmatic solutions which are effective and very fast.

## 1. Kalman Filters
Estimate future locations and velocities based on data. 

performing a **measurement** meant updating our belief by a multiplicative factor, while **moving** involved performing a convolution.
